      "full_text": "Dear Nick,\n\nI want you to do something that will be very difficult for you to do. And I also want you to do something that will be time-consuming. And it will be frustrating. But if you will do what I am about to ask you to do, I will absolutely promise you that you will eventually become a first-class copywriter.\n\nHere's what I want you to do:\n\nI want you to hand-write sales letters. Sales letters that have been proven to work. Not just one or two sales letters, but many, many of them. Ideally, you should hand-write at least five to ten sales letters, word-for-word, exactly as they were originally written.\n\nI know this sounds like tedious work. But you must do this if you want to become a good copywriter.\n\nThe reason is this: When you hand-write a sales letter, your hand will learn. Your eyes will learn. Your brain will learn. And your heart will learn.\n\nWhen you type something, you are not really learning it. You are just learning where the keys are on the keyboard. But when you write something by hand, something different happens. Your hand learns the rhythm of the words. Your brain learns the construction of the sentences. Your eyes learn how to break up the copy into proper paragraphs.\n\nBut that is not all.\n\nWhen you write a sales letter by hand, you will start to understand the psychological principles that are embedded in that letter. You will begin to see the \"tricks\" that the copywriter used. You will start to understand why certain phrases are placed where they are. And most importantly, you will learn the rhythm and flow of good copy.\n\nThis is something that you cannot learn from reading books about copywriting. You cannot learn this from studying advertising theory. You can only learn this by actually doing it.\n\nSo here is my challenge to you: Hand-write five proven sales letters. Not five mediocre sales letters. Five sales letters that have actually made money for the companies that used them.\n\nWhen you finish hand-writing these five letters, hand-write another five. And then another five after that.\n\nAfter you hand-write fifteen proven sales letters, I guarantee you that you will never write the same way again. Your copy will improve dramatically.\n\nThe reason is that your hands, your eyes, and your brain will have learned the patterns of good copy. Your subconscious mind will have been programmed with the rhythms and structures of proven, money-making copy.\n\nThis is something that no copywriting course, no copywriting book, and no copywriting teacher can give you.\n\nOnly your own hands can teach you this.\n\nSo start today. Find a proven sales letter. Print it out. And hand-write it, word-for-word.\n\nThen do it again. And again. And again.\n\nYour future as a copywriter depends on it.\n\nYour friend,\nGary",

      "full_text": "The Beginning of Advertising Science\n\nAdvertising has come to be a fixed principle. It is no longer a matter of guess work, but a carefully applied science. There is a reason for every phase of every ad written by those who have learned the game.\n\nThe time when the most powerful copy was written by poets and men of literary ability has passed. The successful ad of today is written by students of human nature - by men and women who have learned that people are swayed by certain motives, and that these motives can be invoked through certain stimuli.\n\nThe advertiser who ignores these principles is gambling. The one who applies them is working on a basis of science.\n\nIn the early days of advertising, people wrote ads as they would write a short story. They used fine language and flowery phrases. They tried to make ads entertaining. They thought that if an ad was clever, or humorous, or beautifully written, it would be successful.\n\nBut successful advertisers have learned that this is not true.\n\nThe most successful ads are not the most entertaining. They are not necessarily the most beautiful. They are the ads that offer the strongest appeal to the deepest human desires and motives.\n\nEvery person who reads an ad has certain basic needs and desires. These are:\n\n1. The desire for gain - to make money, save money, or get value\n2. The desire for health - to feel good and live long\n3. The desire for beauty - to feel attractive and admired\n4. The desire for comfort - to avoid pain and effort\n5. The desire for safety - to be secure and protected\n6. The desire for love and acceptance - to belong and be valued\n7. The desire for self-improvement - to be better and progress\n\nThe advertiser who appeals to these deep human motives is the advertiser who succeeds.\n\nBut there is more to it than simply knowing what people want. The advertiser must also know HOW to present his appeal in the most persuasive way.\n\nHe must know:\n- What words work best\n- What phrases trigger response\n- What order to present his ideas\n- What details to emphasize\n- What to leave out\n- How to structure his argument\n\nThis knowledge cannot be gained from artistic ability alone. It must be gained through study, testing, and careful observation of what works and what doesn't.\n\nEvery element of a successful ad serves a purpose. Every word choice is deliberate. Every sentence structure is calculated to achieve a specific response.\n\nThis is scientific advertising.\n\nThe poet writes to express himself. The scientist writes to produce a specific result. The advertiser must think and act like a scientist.",

I suddenly realized that the years I had spent waiting for some miraculous inspiration to strike before I could play - that those years were wasted.\n\nI discovered that anyone - yes, ANYONE - could learn to play the piano beautifully, in a matter of a few weeks.\n\nThat was five years ago. And today thousands of people have discovered what I discovered then. These people have found joy and happiness in playing the piano. They have amazed their friends with their sudden ability to play. They have reaped the rewards of being able to sit down at a piano and play any song they desired.\n\nHere is my story:\n\nI was born with no natural musical talent. I was told that I could not learn to play. But I had a desire to learn, deep in my heart. I wanted more than anything else to be able to sit down at a piano and play the way great musicians do.\n\nMy father was a musician, and it always was a dream of mine to follow in his footsteps. But it seemed that I had been denied this gift by nature.\n\nThen one day, a stranger changed my life. He taught me a secret. A secret that musicians had guarded for centuries. A secret that made it possible for me to play the piano in a way that amazed everyone who heard me.\n\nThat stranger told me something so simple, so obvious, that I had overlooked it my entire life.\n\nHe said: \"The reason you cannot play the piano is not because you lack talent. It is because you have been taught incorrectly.\"\n\nHe explained that most people learned to play by reading notes off a page. But this method was slow and difficult. There was a better way.\n\nHe showed me a method that allowed me to begin playing simple melodies within minutes. Within hours, I could play simple songs. Within days, I could play more complex pieces.\n\nWithin weeks, I was playing piano in a way that astonished everyone around me.\n\nWithin months, I had mastered songs that I had previously thought impossible.\n\nThe key was this: Instead of learning to read music first, I learned to PLAY first. My fingers learned the patterns. My hands learned the motions. My mind learned to recognize melodies.\n\nOnce I had learned to play with my fingers and hands and mind, reading music became easy and natural.\n\nThis is the discovery that changed my life. And this is the discovery that has changed the lives of thousands of others.\n\nIf you have always wanted to learn to play the piano, but thought it was too late, or too difficult, or that you lacked talent - I want to tell you something:\n\nYou are wrong.\n\nYou can learn to play the piano. You can learn quickly. You can learn easily. You can learn in a way that brings you joy and satisfaction.\n\nAll you need is the right method. All you need is someone to show you the way.",

I had won their admiration!\n\nThat moment taught me a lesson I shall never forget. Here was I, in a group of intelligent people, gaining respect and admiration simply because I could speak a little French.\n\nMy friend, who had studied French for five years in school, sat there embarrassed because he could not speak a word. Here was I, who had never studied French in school at all, speaking it with ease.\n\nWhat made the difference?\n\nThe difference was in the METHOD.\n\nMy friend had learned French the traditional way - through grammar books and classroom instruction. He had memorized grammar rules. He had conjugated verbs. But he had never actually HEARD the language spoken. He had never practiced speaking it.\n\nI, on the other hand, had discovered a method that taught me to SPEAK first, before I worried about the grammar.\n\nWhen you learn a language the way I learned it, something miraculous happens. Your ear becomes trained to the sounds. Your mouth learns to form the words. Your mind begins to understand the meaning not through translation, but through immersion.\n\nWithin a few weeks of using this method, I was able to understand spoken French. Within a few months, I could speak it with confidence.\n\nThe key was this: I learned the language the way a child learns a language - by hearing it, speaking it, and practicing it, not by studying rules and memorizing conjugations.\n\nEvery person who has ever learned a language successfully has done it this way. They heard the language first. They spoke it first. The grammar came later.\n\nMost language instruction ignores this truth. It teaches grammar first, speaking second. This is backward. It's like teaching someone to swim by having them read a book about swimming before they ever get in the water.\n\nI had discovered the method that nature intended. And the results were remarkable.\n\nAfter that evening in the restaurant, I became curious. If this method worked so well for learning French, would it work for other languages?\n\nI tried it. It worked.\n\nI tried Spanish. It worked.\n\nI tried Italian. It worked.\n\nEvery language responded to this natural method of learning.\n\nAnd now I want to share this discovery with you.\n\nIf you have ever wanted to speak a foreign language, but thought it was too difficult, or that you didn't have a talent for languages - I want to tell you that you are wrong.\n\nYou can learn to speak a foreign language. You can learn quickly. You can learn easily. You can learn in a way that brings you confidence and joy.\n\nAll you need is the right method. The method that teaches you to SPEAK first, not to memorize grammar first.\n\nThe method that teaches you the way a child learns - naturally and easily.",

      "full_text": "The Art of Virtue\nA Letter from Benjamin Franklin on Self-Discipline\n\nI am now, if I can so call it, in the evening of my life. I am past the time when most men think of making improvements in their character or habits. Yet I have found that it is never too late to begin cultivating virtue.\n\nMany years ago, when I was a young man, I conceived the ambition to arrive at moral perfection. I wanted to live without committing any fault. I sought to acquire all the virtues together.\n\nThis was an ambitious goal, and I soon found that my attention must be fixed upon one at a time. It was too difficult to watch my conduct in all respects at all hours of the day.\n\nI therefore made a list of the virtues that seemed most essential to a happy and useful life. I settled upon twelve:\n\n1. Temperance - Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\n2. Silence - Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.\n3. Order - Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.\n4. Resolution - Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.\n5. Frugality - Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; that is, waste nothing.\n6. Industry - Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\n7. Sincerity - Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and if you speak, speak accordingly.\n8. Justice - Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.\n9. Moderation - Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.\n10. Cleanliness - Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.\n11. Tranquility - Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\n12. Humility - Imitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\nI was ambitious to obtain the habitude of all these virtues; but I was surprised to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined. But I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish.\n\nTo this end, I contrived the following method.\n\nI made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues. I ruled every page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marked at the head with a letter for the day.\n\nI crossed these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues.\n\nOn each line, under the column for the day of the week, I made a little black spot to mark the day that I committed some fault against that virtue.\n\nThis was my system: I would confine my attention, for one week, to the perfection of the first of the virtues - Temperance. I would allow myself no pleasure from food, drink, or anything else, except what was necessary for health and strength.\n\nThe next week, I would add Silence to my practice, and so on, proceeding through all the virtues, one week for each.\n\nThis way, in the course of thirteen weeks, I would go through the course of all the virtues once. And I had the satisfaction of seeing fewer and fewer black spots upon my page each week.\n\nI found this method very useful. I used it regularly for many years. The constant attention to the virtues, and the regular checking of my conduct, made it a habit to practice them.\n\nI am not so presumptuous as to think I have attained perfection. Far from it. But I can truly say that this practice has made me a better and happier man than I would otherwise have been.\n\nI urge you to try this method yourself. Choose the virtues you wish to cultivate. Make your little book and your chart. Check yourself each day. You will be surprised at the improvement in your character.\n\nVirtue is not learned from books alone, nor from preaching alone. Virtue is cultivated through constant practice and regular self-examination.\n\nMake a habit of the virtues you wish to possess, and in time they will become second nature to you.",

Yet there are few people who speak or write English correctly all the time.\n\nMany people who are otherwise educated make embarrassing mistakes in grammar, in choice of words, and in pronunciation.\n\nThese errors are not always noticeable in everyday conversation. But they often make a painful impression in formal situations - in business, in public speaking, or in social gatherings where you meet people of culture and refinement.\n\nHere are some of the common mistakes that many intelligent people make:\n\nDo you ever say \"between you and I\"? (Correct: \"between you and me\")\nDo you sometimes use \"ain't\"? (Correct: \"am not\" or \"isn't\")\nDo you ever say \"it's me\" instead of \"it is I\"?\nDo you sometimes confuse \"shall\" and \"will\"?\nDo you sometimes split an infinitive? (Example: \"to quickly go\" instead of \"to go quickly\")\n\nThese mistakes are no longer necessary.\n\nThere is now a simple, interesting way to correct all these errors once and for all. You need not struggle with rules of grammar. You need not memorize conjugations and declensions.\n\nWhat would it mean to you to be able to speak and write with complete confidence? To know that you are using perfect English in all circumstances?\n\nThink how much more effective you could be in your profession. Think how much more impressive you could be in any social situation.\n\nSo many opportunities in life depend on the impression you make in the first few minutes. One word spoken incorrectly. One sentence phrased awkwardly. And the impression is spoiled.\n\nYet these mistakes are so easily corrected.\n\nWe have a method that enables anyone to master correct English in a few days - or a few hours. The cost is small. The effort is small. But the rewards are great.\n\nYour success in business, your social standing, your confidence in every situation - these things often depend on your command of good English.\n\nIt is an investment in yourself that will pay you dividends for the rest of your life.",

There were many competing beers, all claiming similar qualities.\n\nThe bottler was in despair. \"What can we say that our competitors don't say?\" he asked.\n\nI visited the Schlitz brewery to find the answer.\n\nI found something that impressed me tremendously. The process they used was different from all others. I saw the plates glass-lined rooms where the beer was aged. I saw the filtering equipment. I saw the sterilizing of every bottle.\n\nBut then I asked, \"Are all the other breweries doing something similar?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the manager. \"Every brewery uses a similar process. In fact, our process is standard throughout the industry.\"\n\nHere was the challenge: All breweries use essentially the same methods. Yet one brewery succeeds while others fail.\n\nThe answer was not in what they did. The answer was in what they SAID about what they did.\n\nNo other brewery had ever explained their process to the public. No one had ever told consumers about the scientific methods used to create their beer.\n\nSo we created an advertisement that showed the Schlitz process. We explained, in simple terms, everything that was done to make Schlitz beer pure and safe.\n\nWe told how the bottles were sterilized. We explained the aging process. We described the filtering. We made the consumer understand that Schlitz was made with the same care that a pharmacist uses in making medicines.\n\nThe results were astounding.\n\nWithin a very short time, Schlitz moved from fifth place to first place among American beers. The market share increased dramatically. Sales tripled.\n\nWhat made the difference? Not a new process. Not a superior product. Simply the explanation of what was already being done.\n\nThis teaches an important lesson in advertising: Never assume that your process is too technical or too boring to interest consumers. People want to understand how things are made. They want to know why your product is better.\n\nWhen you explain your methods clearly and honestly, you differentiate yourself from competitors who don't explain anything.\n\nThis is the power of reason-why advertising.",

      "full_text": "MY LIFE IN ADVERTISING\n\nI did not begin as an advertising copywriter. I began in other fields. But eventually I discovered that advertising held the key to success for any business.\n\nMy early lessons came through failures and experiments. I tried many approaches that did not work. I wrote ads that fell flat. I made mistakes that cost me money.\n\nBut each failure taught me something. Each mistake was a lesson.\n\nI learned that advertising is not an art - it is a science. You cannot guess at what will work. You must test. You must measure. You must follow the principles that govern human behavior.\n\nOne of my early discoveries was the power of headlines. I realized that most people make up their minds about an ad in the first few seconds. If the headline does not capture their attention, the rest of the ad means nothing.\n\nI began to study what made some headlines work and others fail. I found patterns. I found principles.\n\nI discovered that people respond to certain triggers: curiosity, fear, greed, desire for approval, desire for beauty, desire for health.\n\nWhen I understood these triggers, I could write ads that people could not ignore.\n\nAnother discovery was the importance of the offer. Many ads fail because they do not make a clear, compelling offer. They describe the product beautifully, but they do not tell the reader WHY they should act NOW.\n\nI learned to structure ads so that each element served a purpose. The headline grabbed attention. The opening paragraph established relevance. The body explained benefits. The close made a specific offer.\n\nBut I also learned that the best advertising comes from understanding the customer. What are their fears? What are their desires? What problems are they trying to solve?\n\nWhen I could answer these questions, I could write ads that connected with people emotionally and persuaded them logically.\n\nThe most successful ads I ever wrote were those that addressed a real problem and offered a genuine solution.\n\nI also learned the importance of being willing to change. If something was not working, I did not stubbornly stick with it. I tried a different approach.\n\nI became obsessed with testing and measurement. I wanted to know exactly what worked and what did not.\n\nThis scientific approach to advertising separated me from my competitors. While they relied on intuition and guesswork, I relied on facts and data.\n\nMy advice to anyone entering the field of advertising: Learn the principles. Study what works. Test your theories. Measure your results. Never stop learning.\n\nAdvertising is a craft that rewards those who are willing to work hard and think clearly.",

Not because of clever copy.\n\nThey noticed because we did one thing right: We told them exactly what they wanted to hear.\n\nWomen buying breakfast cereal want two things above all else:\n1. Maximum value for their money\n2. Products that their families will eat\n\nSo instead of waxing poetic about the health benefits of whole wheat, we made a simple statement:\n\n\"Largest Package - Lowest Price.\"\n\nThree words. That's all it took.\n\nWhy did this work so powerfully?\n\nBecause women understood immediately that they were getting the best deal. They were not paying for fancy packaging. They were not paying for elaborate advertising. They were paying for product.\n\nMore cereal for less money. More food on the table for their families. Better value.\n\nThe simplicity of the message combined with its truth created irresistible appeal.\n\nFamilies that have limited budgets need to know where to get the most value. Working mothers need to know which products will give them more for their money.\n\nWhen we told them directly - in the headline - that we offered the largest package at the lowest price, we gave them permission to choose us.\n\nBut we backed up the claim. We actually did offer more product for less money than competitors.\n\nThis is the secret to powerful advertising: Make a claim that is true and that matters to your customer. State it clearly and directly in your headline. Back it up with the product.\n\nToo much advertising tries to be clever or entertaining. But customers don't want entertainment. They want value. They want honesty. They want to know they're making the right choice.\n\nTell them directly. Tell them truthfully. Tell them what benefits them most.\n\nThat is what works.",

      "full_text": "BORON LETTERS #1-3: THE FOUNDATION\n\n[LETTER #1: HOT MARKET SELECTION]\n\nDear Nick,\n\nI want you to understand something crucial about copywriting success. Most people focus on the copy itself. They think that if they can just write the perfect ad, they will succeed.\n\nBut that is only part of the equation.\n\nThe truth is: Market selection is often MORE important than the copy itself.\n\nA mediocre ad in a hot market will outperform a brilliant ad in a cold market every single time.\n\nWhat is a hot market? A hot market is a group of people who desperately want something. They are actively searching for a solution. They have money to spend. And they are ready to buy.\n\nFor example: A person who just got engaged is in a hot market. They need a wedding ring. They are motivated. They will spend money.\n\nA person who is overweight and desperately wants to lose weight is in a hot market. They have tried many solutions. They are frustrated. They will buy almost anything that promises results.\n\nA person who is broke and wants to make money is in a hot market. They will read your ad. They will listen to your offer. They might buy.\n\nBut a person who is not thinking about your product category? That person is in a cold market. Even the best ad will struggle.\n\nSo your first job as a copywriter is to identify hot markets.\n\nWhere are people desperate enough to buy? Where are people searching for solutions? Where is there urgency?\n\nWhen you can answer these questions, copywriting becomes much easier.\n\n[LETTER #2: PERSONALIZATION AND RELEVANCE]\n\nBuilding on what I taught you about hot markets, let me add another critical principle: Personalization.\n\nOnce you have identified a hot market, you must speak directly to that market's specific concerns.\n\nFor example: If your market is \"people who want to lose weight,\" you do not write generic copy about health. You write about THEIR specific concerns.\n\nWhat if they are concerned about looking good for an upcoming event?\nWhat if they are concerned about their health?\nWhat if they are concerned about not having the discipline to stick with a diet?\n\nYour copy must address their specific concern.\n\nThis personalization is what separates mediocre copy from exceptional copy.\n\nWhen a reader feels that you are speaking directly to them - specifically to their situation and their concerns - they pay attention.\n\n[LETTER #3: THE PROFESSIONAL MINDSET]\n\nNow, here is what separates amateurs from professionals in copywriting.\n\nAmateurs write what they think will work.\nProfessionals write what they KNOW will work, based on testing.\n\nAmateurs hope their copy is good.\nProfessionals measure their results.\n\nAmateurs make excuses when copy fails.\nProfessionals learn from failure and improve.\n\nThe professional mindset is this: Every ad is a test. Every response is data. Every result teaches you something.\n\nYou must be willing to measure. You must be willing to iterate. You must be obsessed with results.\n\nThis is how you become great.\n\nYour friend,\nGary",
