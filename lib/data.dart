    content: """Dear Nick,

I want you to do something that will be very difficult for you to do. And I also want you to do something that will be time-consuming. And it will be frustrating. But if you will do what I am about to ask you to do, I will absolutely promise you that you will eventually become a first-class copywriter.

Here's what I want you to do:

I want you to hand-write sales letters. Sales letters that have been proven to work. Not just one or two sales letters, but many, many of them. Ideally, you should hand-write at least five to ten sales letters, word-for-word, exactly as they were originally written.

I know this sounds like tedious work. But you must do this if you want to become a good copywriter.

The reason is this: When you hand-write a sales letter, your hand will learn. Your eyes will learn. Your brain will learn. And your heart will learn.

When you type something, you are not really learning it. You are just learning where the keys are on the keyboard. But when you write something by hand, something different happens. Your hand learns the rhythm of the words. Your brain learns the construction of the sentences. Your eyes learn how to break up the copy into proper paragraphs.

But that is not all.

When you write a sales letter by hand, you will start to understand the psychological principles that are embedded in that letter. You will begin to see the "tricks" that the copywriter used. You will start to understand why certain phrases are placed where they are. And most importantly, you will learn the rhythm and flow of good copy.

This is something that you cannot learn from reading books about copywriting. You cannot learn this from studying advertising theory. You can only learn this by actually doing it.

So here is my challenge to you: Hand-write five proven sales letters. Not five mediocre sales letters. Five sales letters that have actually made money for the companies that used them.

When you finish hand-writing these five letters, hand-write another five. And then another five after that.

After you hand-write fifteen proven sales letters, I guarantee you that you will never write the same way again. Your copy will improve dramatically.

The reason is that your hands, your eyes, and your brain will have learned the patterns of good copy. Your subconscious mind will have been programmed with the rhythms and structures of proven, money-making copy.

This is something that no copywriting course, no copywriting book, and no copywriting teacher can give you.

Only your own hands can teach you this.

So start today. Find a proven sales letter. Print it out. And hand-write it, word-for-word.

Then do it again. And again. And again.

Your future as a copywriter depends on it.

Your friend,
Gary""",

    title: "Scientific Advertising: Ch 1",
    content: """The Beginning of Advertising Science

Advertising has come to be a fixed principle. It is no longer a matter of guess work, but a carefully applied science. There is a reason for every phase of every ad written by those who have learned the game.

The time when the most powerful copy was written by poets and men of literary ability has passed. The successful ad of today is written by students of human nature - by men and women who have learned that people are swayed by certain motives, and that these motives can be invoked through certain stimuli.

The advertiser who ignores these principles is gambling. The one who applies them is working on a basis of science.

In the early days of advertising, people wrote ads as they would write a short story. They used fine language and flowery phrases. They tried to make ads entertaining. They thought that if an ad was clever, or humorous, or beautifully written, it would be successful.

But successful advertisers have learned that this is not true.

The most successful ads are not the most entertaining. They are not necessarily the most beautiful. They are the ads that offer the strongest appeal to the deepest human desires and motives.

Every person who reads an ad has certain basic needs and desires. These are:

1. The desire for gain - to make money, save money, or get value
2. The desire for health - to feel good and live long
3. The desire for beauty - to feel attractive and admired
4. The desire for comfort - to avoid pain and effort
5. The desire for safety - to be secure and protected
6. The desire for love and acceptance - to belong and be valued
7. The desire for self-improvement - to be better and progress

The advertiser who appeals to these deep human motives is the advertiser who succeeds.

But there is more to it than simply knowing what people want. The advertiser must also know HOW to present his appeal in the most persuasive way.

He must know:
- What words work best
- What phrases trigger response
- What order to present his ideas
- What details to emphasize
- What to leave out
- How to structure his argument

This knowledge cannot be gained from artistic ability alone. It must be gained through study, testing, and careful observation of what works and what doesn't.

Every element of a successful ad serves a purpose. Every word choice is deliberate. Every sentence structure is calculated to achieve a specific response.

This is scientific advertising.

The poet writes to express himself. The scientist writes to produce a specific result. The advertiser must think and act like a scientist.""",

    content: """They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano
But When I Started to Play!

Liszt himself couldn't have done it better!

That was the moment I made a strange discovery. I suddenly realized that the years I had spent waiting for some miraculous inspiration to strike before I could play - that those years were wasted.

I discovered that anyone - yes, ANYONE - could learn to play the piano beautifully, in a matter of a few weeks.

That was five years ago. And today thousands of people have discovered what I discovered then. These people have found joy and happiness in playing the piano. They have amazed their friends with their sudden ability to play. They have reaped the rewards of being able to sit down at a piano and play any song they desired.

Here is my story:

I was born with no natural musical talent. I was told that I could not learn to play. But I had a desire to learn, deep in my heart. I wanted more than anything else to be able to sit down at a piano and play the way great musicians do.

My father was a musician, and it always was a dream of mine to follow in his footsteps. But it seemed that I had been denied this gift by nature.

Then one day, a stranger changed my life. He taught me a secret. A secret that musicians had guarded for centuries. A secret that made it possible for me to play the piano in a way that amazed everyone who heard me.

That stranger told me something so simple, so obvious, that I had overlooked it my entire life.

He said: "The reason you cannot play the piano is not because you lack talent. It is because you have been taught incorrectly."

He explained that most people learned to play by reading notes off a page. But this method was slow and difficult. There was a better way.

He showed me a method that allowed me to begin playing simple melodies within minutes. Within hours, I could play simple songs. Within days, I could play more complex pieces.

Within weeks, I was playing piano in a way that astonished everyone around me.

Within months, I had mastered songs that I had previously thought impossible.

The key was this: Instead of learning to read music first, I learned to PLAY first. My fingers learned the patterns. My hands learned the motions. My mind learned to recognize melodies.

Once I had learned to play with my fingers and hands and mind, reading music became easy and natural.

This is the discovery that changed my life. And this is the discovery that has changed the lives of thousands of others.

If you have always wanted to learn to play the piano, but thought it was too late, or too difficult, or that you lacked talent - I want to tell you something:

You are wrong.

You can learn to play the piano. You can learn quickly. You can learn easily. You can learn in a way that brings you joy and satisfaction.

All you need is the right method. All you need is someone to show you the way.""",

    title: "They Grinned (French Waiter)",
    content: """They Grinned When the Waiter Spoke to Me in French
—But I Answered Him Fluently!

Their expressions changed in a flash. I had won their admiration!

That moment taught me a lesson I shall never forget. Here was I, in a group of intelligent people, gaining respect and admiration simply because I could speak a little French.

My friend, who had studied French for five years in school, sat there embarrassed because he could not speak a word. Here was I, who had never studied French in school at all, speaking it with ease.

What made the difference?

The difference was in the METHOD.

My friend had learned French the traditional way - through grammar books and classroom instruction. He had memorized grammar rules. He had conjugated verbs. But he had never actually HEARD the language spoken. He had never practiced speaking it.

I, on the other hand, had discovered a method that taught me to SPEAK first, before I worried about the grammar.

When you learn a language the way I learned it, something miraculous happens. Your ear becomes trained to the sounds. Your mouth learns to form the words. Your mind begins to understand the meaning not through translation, but through immersion.

Within a few weeks of using this method, I was able to understand spoken French. Within a few months, I could speak it with confidence.

The key was this: I learned the language the way a child learns a language - by hearing it, speaking it, and practicing it, not by studying rules and memorizing conjugations.

Every person who has ever learned a language successfully has done it this way. They heard the language first. They spoke it first. The grammar came later.

Most language instruction ignores this truth. It teaches grammar first, speaking second. This is backward. It's like teaching someone to swim by having them read a book about swimming before they ever get in the water.

I had discovered the method that nature intended. And the results were remarkable.

After that evening in the restaurant, I became curious. If this method worked so well for learning French, would it work for other languages?

I tried it. It worked.

I tried Spanish. It worked.

I tried Italian. It worked.

Every language responded to this natural method of learning.

And now I want to share this discovery with you.

If you have ever wanted to speak a foreign language, but thought it was too difficult, or that you didn't have a talent for languages - I want to tell you that you are wrong.

You can learn to speak a foreign language. You can learn quickly. You can learn easily. You can learn in a way that brings you confidence and joy.

All you need is the right method. The method that teaches you to SPEAK first, not to memorize grammar first.

The method that teaches you the way a child learns - naturally and easily.""",

    title: "The Art of Virtue",
    content: """The Art of Virtue
A Letter from Benjamin Franklin on Self-Discipline

I am now, if I can so call it, in the evening of my life. I am past the time when most men think of making improvements in their character or habits. Yet I have found that it is never too late to begin cultivating virtue.

Many years ago, when I was a young man, I conceived the ambition to arrive at moral perfection. I wanted to live without committing any fault. I sought to acquire all the virtues together.

This was an ambitious goal, and I soon found that my attention must be fixed upon one at a time. It was too difficult to watch my conduct in all respects at all hours of the day.

I therefore made a list of the virtues that seemed most essential to a happy and useful life. I settled upon twelve:

1. Temperance - Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
2. Silence - Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.
3. Order - Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.
4. Resolution - Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.
5. Frugality - Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; that is, waste nothing.
6. Industry - Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.
7. Sincerity - Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and if you speak, speak accordingly.
8. Justice - Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.
9. Moderation - Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.
10. Cleanliness - Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.
11. Tranquility - Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.
12. Humility - Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

I was ambitious to obtain the habitude of all these virtues; but I was surprised to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined. But I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish.

To this end, I contrived the following method.

I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues. I ruled every page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marked at the head with a letter for the day.

I crossed these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues.

On each line, under the column for the day of the week, I made a little black spot to mark the day that I committed some fault against that virtue.

This was my system: I would confine my attention, for one week, to the perfection of the first of the virtues - Temperance. I would allow myself no pleasure from food, drink, or anything else, except what was necessary for health and strength.

The next week, I would add Silence to my practice, and so on, proceeding through all the virtues, one week for each.

This way, in the course of thirteen weeks, I would go through the course of all the virtues once. And I had the satisfaction of seeing fewer and fewer black spots upon my page each week.

I found this method very useful. I used it regularly for many years. The constant attention to the virtues, and the regular checking of my conduct, made it a habit to practice them.

I am not so presumptuous as to think I have attained perfection. Far from it. But I can truly say that this practice has made me a better and happier man than I would otherwise have been.

I urge you to try this method yourself. Choose the virtues you wish to cultivate. Make your little book and your chart. Check yourself each day. You will be surprised at the improvement in your character.

Virtue is not learned from books alone, nor from preaching alone. Virtue is cultivated through constant practice and regular self-examination.

Make a habit of the virtues you wish to possess, and in time they will become second nature to you.""",

    title: "Do You Make These Mistakes?",
    content: """DO YOU MAKE THESE MISTAKES IN ENGLISH?

English is one of the most important of all accomplishments. Yet there are few people who speak or write English correctly all the time.

Many people who are otherwise educated make embarrassing mistakes in grammar, in choice of words, and in pronunciation.

These errors are not always noticeable in everyday conversation. But they often make a painful impression in formal situations - in business, in public speaking, or in social gatherings where you meet people of culture and refinement.

Here are some of the common mistakes that many intelligent people make:

Do you ever say "between you and I"? (Correct: "between you and me")
Do you sometimes use "ain't"? (Correct: "am not" or "isn't")
Do you ever say "it's me" instead of "it is I"?
Do you sometimes confuse "shall" and "will"?
Do you sometimes split an infinitive? (Example: "to quickly go" instead of "to go quickly")

These mistakes are no longer necessary.

There is now a simple, interesting way to correct all these errors once and for all. You need not struggle with rules of grammar. You need not memorize conjugations and declensions.

What would it mean to you to be able to speak and write with complete confidence? To know that you are using perfect English in all circumstances?

Think how much more effective you could be in your profession. Think how much more impressive you could be in any social situation.

So many opportunities in life depend on the impression you make in the first few minutes. One word spoken incorrectly. One sentence phrased awkwardly. And the impression is spoiled.

Yet these mistakes are so easily corrected.

We have a method that enables anyone to master correct English in a few days - or a few hours. The cost is small. The effort is small. But the rewards are great.

Your success in business, your social standing, your confidence in every situation - these things often depend on your command of good English.

It is an investment in yourself that will pay you dividends for the rest of your life.""",

    title: "Schlitz Beer Case Study",
    content: """SCHLITZ - THE BEER THAT MADE MILWAUKEE FAMOUS

When we took over the Schlitz account, the beer was practically unknown outside of Milwaukee. There were many competing beers, all claiming similar qualities.

The bottler was in despair. "What can we say that our competitors don't say?" he asked.

I visited the Schlitz brewery to find the answer.

I found something that impressed me tremendously. The process they used was different from all others. I saw the plates glass-lined rooms where the beer was aged. I saw the filtering equipment. I saw the sterilizing of every bottle.

But then I asked, "Are all the other breweries doing something similar?"

"Yes," said the manager. "Every brewery uses a similar process. In fact, our process is standard throughout the industry."

Here was the challenge: All breweries use essentially the same methods. Yet one brewery succeeds while others fail.

The answer was not in what they did. The answer was in what they SAID about what they did.

No other brewery had ever explained their process to the public. No one had ever told consumers about the scientific methods used to create their beer.

So we created an advertisement that showed the Schlitz process. We explained, in simple terms, everything that was done to make Schlitz beer pure and safe.

We told how the bottles were sterilized. We explained the aging process. We described the filtering. We made the consumer understand that Schlitz was made with the same care that a pharmacist uses in making medicines.

The results were astounding.

Within a very short time, Schlitz moved from fifth place to first place among American beers. The market share increased dramatically. Sales tripled.

What made the difference? Not a new process. Not a superior product. Simply the explanation of what was already being done.

This teaches an important lesson in advertising: Never assume that your process is too technical or too boring to interest consumers. People want to understand how things are made. They want to know why your product is better.

When you explain your methods clearly and honestly, you differentiate yourself from competitors who don't explain anything.

This is the power of reason-why advertising.""",

    title: "My Life in Advertising",
    content: """MY LIFE IN ADVERTISING

I did not begin as an advertising copywriter. I began in other fields. But eventually I discovered that advertising held the key to success for any business.

My early lessons came through failures and experiments. I tried many approaches that did not work. I wrote ads that fell flat. I made mistakes that cost me money.

But each failure taught me something. Each mistake was a lesson.

I learned that advertising is not an art - it is a science. You cannot guess at what will work. You must test. You must measure. You must follow the principles that govern human behavior.

One of my early discoveries was the power of headlines. I realized that most people make up their minds about an ad in the first few seconds. If the headline does not capture their attention, the rest of the ad means nothing.

I began to study what made some headlines work and others fail. I found patterns. I found principles.

I discovered that people respond to certain triggers: curiosity, fear, greed, desire for approval, desire for beauty, desire for health.

When I understood these triggers, I could write ads that people could not ignore.

Another discovery was the importance of the offer. Many ads fail because they do not make a clear, compelling offer. They describe the product beautifully, but they do not tell the reader WHY they should act NOW.

I learned to structure ads so that each element served a purpose. The headline grabbed attention. The opening paragraph established relevance. The body explained benefits. The close made a specific offer.

But I also learned that the best advertising comes from understanding the customer. What are their fears? What are their desires? What problems are they trying to solve?

When I could answer these questions, I could write ads that connected with people emotionally and persuaded them logically.

The most successful ads I ever wrote were those that addressed a real problem and offered a genuine solution.

I also learned the importance of being willing to change. If something was not working, I did not stubbornly stick with it. I tried a different approach.

I became obsessed with testing and measurement. I wanted to know exactly what worked and what did not.

This scientific approach to advertising separated me from my competitors. While they relied on intuition and guesswork, I relied on facts and data.

My advice to anyone entering the field of advertising: Learn the principles. Study what works. Test your theories. Measure your results. Never stop learning.

Advertising is a craft that rewards those who are willing to work hard and think clearly.""",

    title: "Puffed Wheat - Largest Package",
    content: """PUFFED WHEAT
LARGEST PACKAGE - LOWEST PRICE

When Puffed Wheat was introduced, housewives across America took notice. Not because of elaborate advertising. Not because of clever copy.

They noticed because we did one thing right: We told them exactly what they wanted to hear.

Women buying breakfast cereal want two things above all else:
1. Maximum value for their money
2. Products that their families will eat

So instead of waxing poetic about the health benefits of whole wheat, we made a simple statement:

"Largest Package - Lowest Price."

Three words. That's all it took.

Why did this work so powerfully?

Because women understood immediately that they were getting the best deal. They were not paying for fancy packaging. They were not paying for elaborate advertising. They were paying for product.

More cereal for less money. More food on the table for their families. Better value.

The simplicity of the message combined with its truth created irresistible appeal.

Families that have limited budgets need to know where to get the most value. Working mothers need to know which products will give them more for their money.

When we told them directly - in the headline - that we offered the largest package at the lowest price, we gave them permission to choose us.

But we backed up the claim. We actually did offer more product for less money than competitors.

This is the secret to powerful advertising: Make a claim that is true and that matters to your customer. State it clearly and directly in your headline. Back it up with the product.

Too much advertising tries to be clever or entertaining. But customers don't want entertainment. They want value. They want honesty. They want to know they're making the right choice.

Tell them directly. Tell them truthfully. Tell them what benefits them most.

That is what works.""",

    content: """BORON LETTERS #1-3: THE FOUNDATION

[LETTER #1: HOT MARKET SELECTION]

Dear Nick,

I want you to understand something crucial about copywriting success. Most people focus on the copy itself. They think that if they can just write the perfect ad, they will succeed.

But that is only part of the equation.

The truth is: Market selection is often MORE important than the copy itself.

A mediocre ad in a hot market will outperform a brilliant ad in a cold market every single time.

What is a hot market? A hot market is a group of people who desperately want something. They are actively searching for a solution. They have money to spend. And they are ready to buy.

For example: A person who just got engaged is in a hot market. They need a wedding ring. They are motivated. They will spend money.

A person who is overweight and desperately wants to lose weight is in a hot market. They have tried many solutions. They are frustrated. They will buy almost anything that promises results.

A person who is broke and wants to make money is in a hot market. They will read your ad. They will listen to your offer. They might buy.

But a person who is not thinking about your product category? That person is in a cold market. Even the best ad will struggle.

So your first job as a copywriter is to identify hot markets.

Where are people desperate enough to buy? Where are people searching for solutions? Where is there urgency?

When you can answer these questions, copywriting becomes much easier.

[LETTER #2: PERSONALIZATION AND RELEVANCE]

Building on what I taught you about hot markets, let me add another critical principle: Personalization.

Once you have identified a hot market, you must speak directly to that market's specific concerns.

For example: If your market is "people who want to lose weight," you do not write generic copy about health. You write about THEIR specific concerns.

What if they are concerned about looking good for an upcoming event?
What if they are concerned about their health?
What if they are concerned about not having the discipline to stick with a diet?

Your copy must address their specific concern.

This personalization is what separates mediocre copy from exceptional copy.

When a reader feels that you are speaking directly to them - specifically to their situation and their concerns - they pay attention.

[LETTER #3: THE PROFESSIONAL MINDSET]

Now, here is what separates amateurs from professionals in copywriting.

Amateurs write what they think will work. Professionals write what they KNOW will work, based on testing.

Amateurs hope their copy is good. Professionals measure their results.

Amateurs make excuses when copy fails. Professionals learn from failure and improve.

The professional mindset is this: Every ad is a test. Every response is data. Every result teaches you something.

You must be willing to measure. You must be willing to iterate. You must be obsessed with results.

This is how you become great.

Your friend,
Gary""",
